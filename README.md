# Bank-customer-default-and-segmentation-
Project Description:
● Loan Default Prediction: Banks need to minimize financial risk by predicting
which customers are likely to default on loans. Accurate predictions can lead
to better loan approval processes and risk management.
● Customer Segmentation: By understanding customer behavior, banks can
target their marketing strategies more effectively, enhancing customer
satisfaction and increasing revenue.
● Product Recommendations: Recommending the right products to
customers based on their past behavior can increase customer loyalty and
boost cross-selling opportunities.
